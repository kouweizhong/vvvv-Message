This node pack defines a new **Message** data link and c# type. Its primary purpose is to help you retain data and performance control if your vvvv project turns bigger than expected, without adding redundant and confusing links. **Message** can help to establish communication between threads or even other applications. 

Structure & Access
------------------
Think of **Message** as a collection of (binsizeable) Spreads of various Types (**bool, int, float, double, string, Transform, Color, Vector**s**, Time, Message**), all into one single object. 

You can create these Message objects with fully spreadable `Create (Message Formular)` and access the individual Spreads with  `Split (Message Formular)`, `Read (Message)` or simply `Info (Message)`. 

It comes with a broad range of handy helper nodes to work with it:
* filter and search certain Messages, handle Message spreads with ease
* inspect and manipulate individual Messages

Furthermore it ships with convenience plugins for persisting Messages to disc or serializing over network
* Json
* MsgPack
* OSC

Formular
--------
Many plugin nodes' pin layout can be edited to your needs with a simple GUI window.
As a more strict alternative, you can select a **Formular**, which you can manage application wide.

Core
----
The core is fully managed and can be used independently of any specific Plugin implementation. It is freely available on nuget under the name [SharpMessage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpMessage/) and also allows direct usage in any other .Net application.
