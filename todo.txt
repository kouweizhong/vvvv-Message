Features Wanted
- wasChanged as a solid property of Message, or maybe even Bin (leave a breadcrumb of the last sync'ing Keep)
- autocast from any vl class (and mimick back)
- dx ressources as valid type in Formular and pintype
- dynamic object wrapper for a Message's dictionary

Treatments
- config pin should be private (and hidden)

Renamings
- AutoSense might be called OnlyUpdateWhenChanged (
- AutoSense should be called Force, and polarity reverse (breaking change?!)

- All dedicated keeps should say so in their name: SafeKeep, SessionKeep, HoldKeep
- Create (Keep) -> ConfigKeep
- (Formular) category should be resorted, it's messy
- formular selection pin is still called "Message Formular" - shorter, loose the "Message" here
- "Message.Spread" -> "Message" (Sift, ..)


Girlpower Bugs
- 101 "Event" should not have binned Foo
- liveosc some split node tries to retrieve Ableton.Track instead of LiveOSC.Track
