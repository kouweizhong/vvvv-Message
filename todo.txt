Features accomplished
- wasChanged as a solid property of Message, or maybe even Bin (leave a managed breadcrumb of the last sync'ing Keep)
- dx ressources as valid type in Formular and pintype
- less Gui windows
- AutoSense should be called Force, and polarity reverse (breaking change?!)
- formular selection pin is still called "Message Formular" - shorter, loose the "Message" here

Features Wanted
- vl version (core only, best done by xml, not attributes)
- autocast from any vl class (and mimick back), might need converters for all vvvv special types
- dynamic object wrapper for a Message's dictionary
- faster TypeIdentity - split into two internal dictionaries
- split should have a verbose toggle

Bugs
 - pin order is not deterministic
 - formular fails in 101 / Datatypes

Treatments
- config pin should be private (and hidden)
